This repository contains a demonstration of a common error in COBOL programs involving the comparison of numeric literals and variables.  The example shows how using a literal instead of a variable in a conditional statement can lead to unexpected program behavior, such as infinite loops or incorrect calculations. The solution demonstrates the correct usage of variables to ensure accurate conditional logic.
